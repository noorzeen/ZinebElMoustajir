## How Will I be Marked?

For this exercise, you will be marked on the following:

- **Have you used modern CSS layout techniques - including CSS Flexbox - to arrange content on the page?**  
    If you are unsure about this, look back on the Week 4 resources on Ultra. You may need to use more than one layout technique.

- **Have you arranged the gallery images and videos as shown in the screenshot?**  
    The images and the videos should all have the same height, but may have different widths and/or may be cropped. The video should have controls that allow the user to play and pause the video.

- **Have you used the [standard HTML structure](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) shown in class? Have you used semantic HTML elements?**  
    If you are unsure about this, look back on the week 1 resources on Ultra.

- **Is your code clearly formatted, indented, and commented?.**  
    *(Hint: Visual Studio Code can [format code automatically](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting)!)*

- **Are your project folder and GitHub repository well organised?**

To complete this exercise, you will need to understand the content covered during weeks 1-4. However, you may optionally earn extra marks by using additional techniques to extend your solution further.

You will not be marked for accuracy. In other words, it does not matter if there are typos or minor differences between your solution and the screenshot. **However**, you **must** replicate minor details shown in the screenshot. For example, in the screenshot, all of the images and videos have no gaps between them. This should be the case in your solution too.
