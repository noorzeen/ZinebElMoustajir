## How Will I be Marked?

For this exercise, you will be marked on the following:

- **Have you efficiently used CSS styling techniques shown on the page?**  
    This includes styling the text (font, size, colour), the background colours, and any other details visible in the screenshot. This also includes constraining the width of the content to not be too wide.

- **Have you used the [standard HTML structure](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) shown in class? Have you used semantic HTML elements?**  
    If you are unsure about this, look back on the week 1 resources on Ultra.

- **Is your code clearly formatted, indented, and commented?**   
    *(Hint: Visual Studio Code can [format code automatically](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting)!)*

- **Are your project folder and GitHub repository well organised?**

To complete this exercise, you will need to understand the content covered during weeks 1-2. However, you may optionally earn extra marks by using additional techniques to extend your solution further. You may also earn extra marks by using additional styling techniques not shown in the screenshot.

You will not be marked for accuracy. In other words, it does not matter if there are typos or styling differences between your solution and the screenshot. **However**, you **must** use all the styling techniques shown in the screenshot. For example, if the screenshot changes the default font, your solution must do so too.
