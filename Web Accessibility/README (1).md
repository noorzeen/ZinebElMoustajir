# Set Exercise 4: Web Accessibility

## Task

**The webpage shown in this screenshot has multiple accessibility issues.**

**For this Set Exercise, you must create a new version of the page that is more accessible.**

The page is from a travel photography blog, where users can buy high-quality prints of the photos shown. Users can add photographs to their basket using the button under each photo. They can go to a separate checkout page using the shopping cart button. 

You do not need to program the ability to add to the basket. You also do not need to program the checkout page. However, knowing what these elements are supposed to do may change how you program the page.

A copy of the text used is provided in [content.md](content.md). The images used are provided in this folder.

## How Will I be Marked?

For this exercise, you will be marked on the following:

- **Have you used HTML/CSS to ensure content on the page is accessible visually *and* via a screen reader?**  
    If you are unsure about this, look back on the Week 5 resources on Ultra.

- **Have you used HTML to ensure all interactive parts of the page can be accessed using different input devices?**  
    Interactive parts of the page include the buttons and the links. If you are unsure about this, look back on the Week 5 resources on Ultra.

- **Have you used the [standard HTML structure](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) shown in class? Have you used semantic HTML elements?**  
    If you are unsure about this, look back on the week 1 resources on Ultra.

- **Is your code clearly formatted, indented, and commented?**   
    *(Hint: Visual Studio Code can [format code automatically](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting)!)*

- **Are your project folder and GitHub repository well organised?**

To complete this exercise, you will need to understand the content covered during weeks 1-5. However, you may optionally earn extra marks by using additional techniques to extend your solution further.

You **must** include all the key elements shown in the screenshot. For example, if the screenshot contains buttons, your solution should too. However, as part of this exercise, we expect that your webpage will be different from the one in the screenshot.
